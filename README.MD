Triage Grading Tool

By: Eric Chavarria

Suppressed Warnings:
    There are two suppressed warnings in this application. They are both found in MainController.java,
they suppress the "unused" warning. The reason I did this was because I did not need to use the "actionEvent" anywhere
other than the initialization of the functions for both showRubric and showGradingScale.

Build Instructions:
    You should be able to run it by running Main.java. You can traverse the app using the two buttons on the home page.
